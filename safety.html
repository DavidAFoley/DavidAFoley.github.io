            <h3 class="post-title">Registration?</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>There is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40684581">much talk about registration</a> at the moment. This proposal has encountered a mixed reception with drone fliers: commercial users are already subject to a strict regime with the requirement for a PfCO from the CAA. Recreational users are currently neither have to register nor to pass any awareness/competency test. Many like it that way. I'm a fan of registration. It won't solve the problem of renegade drone users, but it will help provide some security about the deployment and use of drones. Like many, I have good ideas about how I would like a registration system to work.</p>
              <p>Some people see registration as either an infringement of their freedoms or an example of an overbearing state. I don't see it as either. Flying a drone has the potential to be either dangerous or intrusive, if not carried out properly. The things you need to do to make your flight as safe as can reasonably be expected are not onerous. They do require more though, than simply getting the drone out of the box, charging the battery and having a go. Registration is a reasonable response from a society that wants people to enjoy drones responsibly.</p>
              <p>Some people wonder if registration will have any effect on improving safety. Surely, human nature is such that those who would fly safely anyway will dutifully register their drones and those who would show little concern for others will carry on doing so and won't register. I think it's true that there will be some people who won't register and that they may well be the people who are flying with poor airmanship. It strikes me that the majority of people would register, if it was required, and that this will help them understand their responsibilities and adhere to them. It also seems like it would make it easier for retailers if they knew there was one place to direct people.</p>
              <p>Whilst I think that drone registration is a good idea, there are currently very fe details about how it will operate. Here are a few suggestions of mine:</p>
              <ul id="post-list">
                <li><strong>Make the cost proportionate</strong> - don't make registration seem disportionately expensive compared to the cost of the hobby (taking into account the cost of the drone and subsequent equipment). Presumably the scheme will have to cover its costs - so don't make it an expensive delivery model. Registration by app downloaded to the owner's smartphone and enabled using the barcode on the manufacturer's packaging sounds like a low cost way to go. Making it disproportionately expensive would surely discourage those you would most want to take part in the scheme.</li>
                <li><strong>Strong penalties</strong> - for people flying unregistered drones there should be a pretty severe penalty. Drone confiscation and destruction seems like a good place to start.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide a quick and responsive service</strong> - make registration quick and easy. If people have to post something off and wait weeks to get a reply, uptake will be low.</li>

            <h3 class="post-title">A word about safety</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I don't mean to burst anyone's bubble about the excitement of flying a drone but it is worth talking about safe flying. It's a topic I'm passionate about and will come back to  quite regularly. That's not to mean I'm a killjoy, you won't find safety requirements so proscriptive that it is impossible to fly here, but I do think about safety first and foremost whenever I'm thinking about flying or am flying.</p>
              <p>This is a responsibility beholden on all drone pilots. You may be flying for recreational rather than commercial reasons (and by the way, if you're selling your creations you need to have a PfCO - Permission for Commercial Operation - from the Civil Aviation Authority) but you still owe a duty of care to everyone else. You may also think this is all overblown. After all, your drone is pretty light, mainly plastic and seems very dependable. All of that is true, but when you're flying it at any height, or any speed, and something goes wrong - that small plastic device can cause serious injury. You don't have to look far on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News webpage</a> to find some horror stories about what can go wrong.</p>
              <p>The good news is, you can easily take practical steps to minimise the risk. Firstly, familiarise yourself with the drone code. You can find this <a href="http://dronesafe.uk">here</a>.</p>

                <img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="postpic002.png">
              </div>
              <p>So:</p>
              <ul id="post-list">
                <li>Not in restricted zones (e.g. airfields, prisons)</li>
                <li>No more than 400ft high (less likely to contact aircraft)</li>
                <li>In visual line of sight (so you can see where it's going and what is all around it)</li>
                <li>50m away from individuals and 150m from crowds and built up areas</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Make sure you look after your craft. Simple measures like keeping it clean, looking for cracks or dents, ensuring everything is screwed up tight, changing propellers if you scratch or dent them. These can make a real difference.</p>
              <p>Prepare before you fly. What is the weather forecast? Can your craft cope with the conditions? Are you equipped for the conditions so that you're not distracted? Have someone with you, who can help be your eyes and ears whilst you are flying.</p>
              <p>It's not that hard, but we all need to do it. There's more than this that we can do as drone pilots, but start with remembering to do all of these. Otherwise, the best case scenario is society will run out of patience with us as a group. The worst case scenario is you will injure yourself or someone else. Neither of which bear thinking about. If you have any doubts about the safety of your flight, then there is no doubt: don't fly.</p>
              <p>Be safe. Then you <em>really can enjoy yourself</em> and get all this wonderful hobby has to offer.</p>
