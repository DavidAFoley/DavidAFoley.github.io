            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I don't mean to burst anyone's bubble about the excitement of flying a drone but it is worth talking about safe flying. It's a topic I'm passionate about and will come back to  quite regularly. That's not to mean I'm a killjoy, you won't find safety requirements so proscriptive that it is impossible to fly here, but I do think about safety first and foremost whenever I'm thinking about flying or am flying.</p>
              <p>This is a responsibility beholden on all drone pilots. You may be flying for recreational rather than commercial reasons (and by the way, if you're selling your creations you need to have a PfCO - Permission for Commercial Operation - from the Civil Aviation Authority) but you still owe a duty of care to everyone else. You may also think this is all overblown. After all, your drone is pretty light, mainly plastic and seems very dependable. All of that is true, but when you're flying it at any height, or any speed, and something goes wrong - that small plastic device can cause serious injury. You don't have to look far on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News webpage</a> to find some horror stories about what can go wrong.</p>
              <p>The good news is, you can easily take practical steps to minimise the risk. Firstly, familiarise yourself with the drone code. You can find this <a href="http://dronesafe.uk">here</a>.</p>

              </div>
              <p>So:</p>
              <ul id="post-list">
                <li>Not in restricted zones (e.g. airfields, prisons)</li>
                <li>No more than 400ft high (less likely to contact aircraft)</li>
                <li>In visual line of sight (so you can see where it's going and what is all around it)</li>
                <li>50m away from individuals and 150m from crowds and built up areas</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Make sure you look after your craft. Simple measures like keeping it clean, looking for cracks or dents, ensuring everything is screwed up tight, changing propellers if you scratch or dent them. These can make a real difference.</p>
              <p>Prepare before you fly. What is the weather forecast? Can your craft cope with the conditions? Are you equipped for the conditions so that you're not distracted? Have someone with you, who can help be your eyes and ears whilst you are flying.</p>
              <p>It's not that hard, but we all need to do it. There's more than this that we can do as drone pilots, but start with remembering to do all of these. Otherwise, the best case scenario is society will run out of patience with us as a group. The worst case scenario is you will injure yourself or someone else. Neither of which bear thinking about. If you have any doubts about the safety of your flight, then there is no doubt: don't fly.</p>
              <p>Be safe. Then you <em>really can enjoy yourself</em> and get all this wonderful hobby has to offer.</p>
