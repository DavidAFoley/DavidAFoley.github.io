            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Have you ever found something so exhilerating and stimulating that you just wanted to do it again, and again and again? That was how I felt the first time I flew a drone. And the next, and the the next, and still feel several years and hundreds of flights later. There is something about drone flying that feels special and that I've never tired of.</p>
              <p>It's hard to encapsulate in words exactly what it is that makes drone flying so extraordinary, but I think there are three aspects that particularly stand out.</p>
              <p>Firstly, although you never leave the ground yourself the feel of piloting a craft that is flying, especially with the advent of First Person View (FPV) - i.e. the ability to see a view on your screen routed directly from the craft) - is one of flying. Flying is special, very special. I doubt many people, the world over, have failed to imagine what it would be like to fly, and piloting a drone gives you some of that sensation.</p>
              <p>Secondly,  flying a drone allows you to see the world from an entirely new perspective. Places you thought you knew well, and that you have seen hundreds or thousands of time, suddenly reveal new and enticing sides. You can explore areas you know intimately as if for the first time again. Patterns that you can't recognise from ground level suddenly become obvious from above. Exploration is writ large in drone flying.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, like all photography, you are painting with light. With a drone you can put your camera in places that allow you to paint with light that you would otherwise not be able to access. Angles change, panoramas appear and light dapples places you couldn't otherwise see. It's for some reason that people refer to drones as tripods in the sky.</p>
              <p>I leave you with a photo I took of Cleadon Hills in the North East of England, a place I have walked in many times, but this is a photo I took with a drone that captures the place better than any other I have taken.</p>
