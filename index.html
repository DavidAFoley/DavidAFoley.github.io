            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Across much of photo/videography practitioners like to talk about equipment. Aerial photography is no different!</p>
              <p>I fly the <a href="http://www.dji.com/phantom-3-standard">DJI Phantom 3 Standard</a>. The choice of drones available to buy now is incredible and increasing all the time. There are multiple manufacturers that are credible and attractive. <a href="http://www.dji.com">DJI</a> is the largest of the consumer drone manufacturers, and perhaps not surprisingly, many people's route into aerial photography.</p>
              <img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="postpic008.jpg">
              <p>You can spend a lot (<em>really, a lot!</em>) of money on a drone. The DJI Phantom 3 Standard is a good entry point, for a few hundred pounds you can be up and flying with a stable platform and reasonable camera and able to access most of the functionality that will enable you to capture stunning aerial shots. In terms of practicality, reliability and value for money, its pretty hard to beat.</p>
              <p>It's a standard quad: four propellers powered by four brushless motors. The camera shoots 2.7k video footage and 12MP stills. It uses the DJI Phantom 3 LiPo battery for power, which should be good for 15-20 mins of flight depending on conditions and at what reserve (I set my reminder to return home at 30%) you bring the drone home. The remote is comfortable to hold and has a capacious battery that easily lasts five or more flights. Its range is easily sufficient for flights within VLOS (visual line of sight). The DJI go app works seamlessly with the drone and gives you FPV as well as flight modes like course hold, follow me, point of interest and waypoints. The remote controls the gimbal as well as the drone so you can pan up and down remotely.</p>
              <p>One day I will upgrade, but I will always have an affinity to the DJI phantom 3 - it's an amazingly capable drone at a very obtainable price.</p>

            <h3 class="post-title">Useful resources: great apps</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>As with most parts of our life technology is opening up new opportunities and enabling us to pursue our interest in ever different ways. Aerial photography is no different, in fact, because it is an emerging technology itself, you could well expect it to be at the leading edge of exploring what technology can help you do. I list here a few of the resources that I have found to be worth investing time in. This is a far from comprehensive list of what is out there, just some of my favourites.</p>
              <ol id="post-numlist">
                <li><strong>DJI Go</strong><br>
                  <img style="auto;display:block" src="postpic003.png">
                  <p>There are a variety of pilot interface apps out there, but the one produced by DJI (NB: for use with DJI drones) is a really good one. I've found it reliable and also intuitive. The layout is uncluttered and you get a good, clear feed from the onboard camera.</p></li>
                <li><strong>NATS Drone Assist</strong><br>
                  <img style="auto;display:block" src="postpic004.png">
                  <p>Well done to NATS for producing such a good app. This helps with your pre-flight preparation, enabling you to check the airspace for suitability to fly, and acting as a very useful prompt of the drone code. Added is the ability to register your flight so that other users can see in which vicinity you are operating (this only works if you register your flight - please do, it helps everyone).</p></li>
                <li><strong>Phantom Pilots</strong><br>
                  <img style="auto;display:block" src="postpic005.png">
                  <p>This is not an app but an online community. You can post questions, answer them if you have the knowledge and see previous threads. It is a mine of information and there are some very knowledgeable pilots as well as some interesting threads on this site.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Dark Sky</strong><br>
                  <img style="auto;display:block" src="postpic006.png">
                  <p>A really good weather app. Giving great local level data and in a very useable format. I've found it to be one of the most accurate forecasts I've used. You can also contribute weather observations of your own to help them validate their forecasts.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Drone Deploy</strong><br>
                  <img style="auto;display:block" src="postpic007.png">
                  <p>Useful if you want to take a series of photos of a site in order to create some sort of map. Has both free and paid for versions. Remember, if you're making any sort of return on your work you need a PfCO from the CAA.</p></li>

            <h3 class="post-title">A word about safety</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I don't mean to burst anyone's bubble about the excitement of flying a drone but it is worth talking about safe flying. It's a topic I'm passionate about and will come back to  quite regularly. That's not to mean I'm a killjoy, you won't find safety requirements so proscriptive that it is impossible to fly here, but I do think about safety first and foremost whenever I'm thinking about flying or am flying.</p>
              <p>This is a responsibility beholden on all drone pilots. You may be flying for recreational rather than commercial reasons (and by the way, if you're selling your creations you need to have a PfCO - Permission for Commercial Operation - from the Civil Aviation Authority) but you still owe a duty of care to everyone else. You may also think this is all overblown. After all, your drone is pretty light, mainly plastic and seems very dependable. All of that is true, but when you're flying it at any height, or any speed, and something goes wrong - that small plastic device can cause serious injury. You don't have to look far on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News webpage</a> to find some horror stories about what can go wrong.</p>
              <p>The good news is, you can easily take practical steps to minimise the risk. Firstly, familiarise yourself with the drone code. You can find this <a href="http://dronesafe.uk">here</a>.</p>
              <div class="portrait-pic">
                <img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="postpic002.png">
              </div>
              <p>So:</p>
              <ul id="post-list">
                <li>Not in restricted zones (e.g. airfields, prisons)</li>
                <li>No more than 400ft high (less likely to contact aircraft)</li>
                <li>In visual line of sight (so you can see where it's going and what is all around it)</li>
                <li>50m away from individuals and 150m from crowds and built up areas</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Make sure you look after your craft. Simple measures like keeping it clean, looking for cracks or dents, ensuring everything is screwed up tight, changing propellers if you scratch or dent them. These can make a real difference.</p>
              <p>Prepare before you fly. What is the weather forecast? Can your craft cope with the conditions? Are you equipped for the conditions so that you're not distracted? Have someone with you, who can help be your eyes and ears whilst you are flying.</p>
              <p>It's not that hard, but we all need to do it. There's more than this that we can do as drone pilots, but start with remembering to do all of these. Otherwise, the best case scenario is society will run out of patience with us as a group. The worst case scenario is you will injure yourself or someone else. Neither of which bear thinking about. If you have any doubts about the safety of your flight, then there is no doubt: don't fly.</p>
              <p>Be safe. Then you <em>really can enjoy yourself</em> and get all this wonderful hobby has to offer.</p>

            <h3 class="post-title">Aerial photography: A love affair</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Have you ever found something so exhilerating and stimulating that you just wanted to do it again, and again and again? That was how I felt the first time I flew a drone. And the next, and the the next, and still feel several years and hundreds of flights later. There is something about drone flying that feels special and that I've never tired of.</p>
              <p>It's hard to encapsulate in words exactly what it is that makes drone flying so extraordinary, but I think there are three aspects that particularly stand out.</p>
              <p>Firstly, although you never leave the ground yourself the feel of piloting a craft that is flying, especially with the advent of First Person View (FPV) - i.e. the ability to see a view on your screen routed directly from the craft) - is one of flying. Flying is special, very special. I doubt many people, the world over, have failed to imagine what it would be like to fly, and piloting a drone gives you some of that sensation.</p>
              <p>Secondly,  flying a drone allows you to see the world from an entirely new perspective. Places you thought you knew well, and that you have seen hundreds or thousands of time, suddenly reveal new and enticing sides. You can explore areas you know intimately as if for the first time again. Patterns that you can't recognise from ground level suddenly become obvious from above. Exploration is writ large in drone flying.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, like all photography, you are painting with light. With a drone you can put your camera in places that allow you to paint with light that you would otherwise not be able to access. Angles change, panoramas appear and light dapples places you couldn't otherwise see. It's for some reason that people refer to drones as tripods in the sky.</p>
              <p>I leave you with a photo I took of Cleadon Hills in the North East of England, a place I have walked in many times, but this is a photo I took with a drone that captures the place better than any other I have taken.</p>
